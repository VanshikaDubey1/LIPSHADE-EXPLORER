    -   In your first terminal, start the Next.js app:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

    -   In a second terminal, start the Genkit development server:
        ```sh
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```

5.  **Open the app:**
    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## ü§ñ How the AI Works

The core functionality is powered by two Genkit flows that chain together:

1.  **`detectLipstickColor`**: This flow takes the user's image and uses the Gemini vision model to analyze the lips and return the dominant color as a hex code.
2.  **`matchLipstickShade`**: This flow receives the hex code, searches a mock database for the top 3 closest color matches, and then uses a second prompt to have the AI act as a beauty expert, selecting the single best product to recommend to the user. A fallback is in place to always return the closest match if the AI fails.
